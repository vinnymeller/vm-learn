# vm-learn
attempts at implementing ml algorithms myself, &amp; trying out my own fun stuff. hopefully i can package it in a nice little box

the base neural net code I've added so far is from brandon rohrer's online miniclass which can be found at https://end-to-end-machine-learning.teachable.com/courses -> #312
